# Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)
Linear, Poisson,  Regression, Negative Binomial

    #Multiple Linear Regression (sm.OLS): 
    This method models the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables by fitting a linear equation to the observed data.

    #Poisson Regression (sm.GLM with family sm.families.Poisson):
    While Poisson regression is often used for count data, in this context, it is still applied in a multiple regression setting.

    #Negative Binomial Regression (sm.GLM with family sm.families.NegativeBinomial):
    Similar to Poisson regression, this method is applied in a multiple regression context but allows for over-dispersion in the count data.
